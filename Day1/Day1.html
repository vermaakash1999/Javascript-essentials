        <h1>Question 1</h1>
        <h2>console.log()</h2>
        <p>
            Mainly used to log(print) the output to the console. We can put any type inside the log(), be it a string,
            array, object, boolean etc.
        </p>
        <h2>console.error()</h2>
        <p>
            Used to log error message to the console. Useful in testing of code. By default the error message will be
            highlighted with red color.
        </p>
        <h2>console.warn()</h2>
        <p>
            Used to log warning message to the console. By default the warning message will be highlighted with yellow
            color.
        </p>
        <h2>console.clear()</h2>
        <p>
            Used to clear the console. The console will be cleared, in case of Chrome a simple overlayed text will be
            printed like : ‘Console was cleared’ while in firefox no message is returned.
        </p>
        <h2>console.time() and concole.timeend()</h2>
        <p>
            Whenever we want to know the amount of time spend by a block or a function, we can make use of the time()
            and timeEnd() methods provided by the javascript console object. They take a label which must be same, and
            the code inside can be anything( function, object, simple console).
        </p>
        <h2>console.table()</h2>
        <p>
            This method allows us to generate a table inside a console. The input must be an array or an object which
            will be shown as a table.
        </p>
        <h2>console.count()</h2>
        <p>
            This method is used to count the number that the function hit by this counting method.
        </p>
        <h2>console.group() and console.groupEnd()</h2>
        <p>
            group() and groupEnd() methods of the console object allows us to group contents in a separate block, which
            will be indented. Just like the time() and the timeEnd() they also accepts label, again of same value.
        </p>

        <h1>Question 2</h1>
        <p>
            var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
        </p>
        <p>
            var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not
            re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let
            and const variables are not initialized.
        </p>
        <p>
            While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
        </p>

        <h1>Question 3</h1>
        <p>
            Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.

            There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or
            primary), composite (or reference), and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data
            types. Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. Whereas
            Undefined and Null are special data types.
